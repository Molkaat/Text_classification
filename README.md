Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of text data into various categories using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The model leverages the scikit-learn library for training and testing the classifier. Text data is preprocessed (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.) and vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features before feeding it into the SVM model.

Features:
Text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal)
TF-IDF vectorization
SVM classifier for text classification
Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib (for visualizing results)
nltk (for text preprocessing)
joblib (for saving the model)
